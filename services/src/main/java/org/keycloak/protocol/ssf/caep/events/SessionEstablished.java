 * The Session Established event signifies that the Transmitter has established a new session for the subject.

 * <ul>
 * <li>A service acting as a Transmitter can close the loop with the IdP after a user has been federated from the IdP</li>
 * <li>An IdP can detect unintended logins</li>
 * <li>A Receiver can establish an inventory of user sessions</li>
